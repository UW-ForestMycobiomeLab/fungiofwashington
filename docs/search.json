The hymenium is toothed rather than gilled or pored. The majority of the fruiting body is a cream color, that when moist, exude a thick red fluid in droplets, which give it the appearance of bleeding. Often, the fruiting bodies will grow closely together (1).\nCap / Pileus Characteristics:\nThe cap is convexed to flat, and is typically uneven, and sometimes depressed in the center. Initially the cap is a cream color but will become a slight brown-red color as it ages. It is covered densely by small hairs that give the fruiting body a velvety texture, but as it ages, the hairs will shed to make the texture smooth (1). \nGills / Pores / Spines / Teeth / Etc.:\nThe underside of the cap is covered in teeth that make up the hymenium, and the stipe is as well. The teeth on the stipe have a pink tinge to the cream color of the cap, which fades to a grayish brown as the fruiting body matures. The stipe is short and thick, and often deformed. Where the stem meets the ground, it takes on a bulbous shape (1). \nStipe / Stem / Attachment / Ring / Volva / Base:\nThe stem is thick, very short, and often deformed. It becomes bulbous where it penetrates the ground, and may root into the soil for several centimeters.\nSpore Print Color:\nBrown\nMicroscopic Features (if available): (spore size & shape, cystidia, etc.)\nSpores generally spherical but with one more pointed end and covered in small nodules. They are about 5 by 4 μm.\nOther Diagnostic Characters: (odor, bruising reactions, latex, color change, etc.)\nIn original species description, odor described as similar to hickory nuts. Cap is dark brown to black when bruised.\nSimilar Species / Potential Confusions:\nHydnellum scrobiculatum (2)\nHydnellum diabolus (1)"

Namely Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and many pine species (2). They tend to grow in the duff, the layer of organic matter that is partially to fully decomposed (2). However they have also been found among mosses (1).\nHost Associations (if applicable):\nH. peckii associates with conifer species within its ranges (1). In the Puget Sound area it is associated with Douglas-fir, hemlocks, true firs, and lodgepole pine along the Oregon coast. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with these trees."

Morphology & Identification\n\nFruiting Body Description: around 5 cm tall, conical cap, brown cap and cream colored stalk, ridges on cap\nCap / Pileus Characteristics: Conical shape with brown color. Mature specimens are dark brown-black. Younger specimens are brown-to-tan. Full of ridges and pits (honeycomb appearance). Pits are elongated vertically. Attached to the stipe via a shallow sinus. Because of the burn-site substrate and charred environment, specimens may carry fire residue on the surface.\nGills / Pores / Spines / Teeth / Etc.: Hollow underside.\nStipe / Stem / Attachment / Ring / Volva / Base: Hollow like the cap, but one of the diagnostic features of M. exuberance is that the stem is often chambered or layered, especially near the base. Key distinguishing trait. Surface may show shallow longitudinal grooves or fluting, especially near the base. Stipe is typically white to pale colored, especially toward the top; near the base it may become slightly darker or show brownish or ashy discoloration from its substrate. Somewhat firm, the presence of internal chambering may make the stipe appear somewhat segmented when layered or cut vertically.\nSpore Print Color: Generally, true morels produce a cream to pale yellow spore deposit.\nMicroscopic Features (if available): (spore size & shape, cystidia, etc.) Morphologically plastic, many Morchella species look similar. One key diagnostic trait are the capitate acroparaphyses on the sterile ridges of the cap have club-shaped tips. The spores are ellipsoid, hyaline, and smooth/faintly ornamented. They have 8-spored asci typical of ascomycetes. They have septate hyphae.\nOther Diagnostic Characters: (odor, bruising reactions, latex, color change, etc.) Burn site habitat is a strong ecological clue. Cap ridges darkening with pits that are elongated vertically, brown to tan. Cap attached to stipe by a shallow sinus. tipe often showing chambered or layered internal structure. A key microscopic clue are capitate acroparaphyses on sterile ridges.\nSimilar Species / Potential Confusions: Morchella eximia – uniformly hollow, walls thinner Morchella sextelata – hollow, but stipe tends to be longer and more fragile Morchella tomentosa – Thick stipe tissue, not evenly hollow, often cotton-like when young Morchella importuna – hollow, but fruit in mulch, not burns."

Individually the spores on the conidiophores are very small, but clumped together on the insect they are visible. The conidiophores burst out of the insect, and the conidia (spores) form at the end, forming a thick layer on the host.\nCap / Pileus Characteristics: There is no cap.\nGills / Pores / Spines / Teeth / Etc.: There are none of these.\nStipe / Stem / Attachment / Ring / Volva / Base: Not applicable.\nSpore Print Color: In a non-traditional sense, it is white. If an insect infected with Entomophthora muscae dies on glass, it will leave a white ring of spores around it.\nMicroscopic Features (if available): (spore size & shape, cystidia, etc.) The spores are white and circular with thick walls for winter survival.\nOther Diagnostic Characters: (odor, bruising reactions, latex, color change, etc.) The dead insect will climb to a high point and strike a “death-pose,” where it will lock onto a high point and spread its wings, before dying, making it so the spores can be released easily and effectively.\nSimilar Species / Potential Confusions: Entomophthora syrphi, which is pretty similar but with far less data, seems to infect the underside of specific insects."

There are many sightings of this fungus around the Sound, which makes sense due to the environmental needs of the fungus being moist and cool. There are a few other sightings south and east of the Sound, but none in eastern WA, as it is too hot and dry there.\nConservation Status (state, federal, red list): The conservation status of E. muscae in North America has not been assessed, and it is listed as unranked due to lack of data.\nThreats / Pressures: The main pressures of Entomophthora muscae are environmental, as it has no known predators. Therefore, the weather and tempature is what will effect it most, as it needs cool and moist environments to thrive.\nManagement or Monitoring Notes: The only way to monitor the fungus is by monitoring the flies, and there is no current management for killing the fungus, but flies have been known to seak heat to slow the fungus growth."

Other Notes & Observations\n\nField Notes / Observations: Some have observed its existence around pines and other firs besides the Doug fir.\nQuestions / Uncertainties:\n\nUncertain about the elevation range \nNo cultural importance was written about, but it could exist, just not in the literature. \n\nFun facts\n\nR. vinicolor can grow under significant water stress and remains active under drought conditions. This leads to increased establishment and survival rate of inoculated tree seedlings on harsh, dry sites. \nR. vinicolor can enhance the net photosynthesis of Douglas-fir seedlings. \nR. vinicolor is a valuable model organism for studying the population genetics of ectomycorrhizal fungi due to its clear association with Douglas-fir and its distinct genetic markers."

It receives carbon from the trees in exchange.\nIt produces a toxin in order to immobilize the insects prior to hyphae invasion. In an experiment done by Klironomos & Hart (2001], 15N-labeled springtails were placed in the presence of only the fungus, not the plant roots, but the fungus was in contact with the Pinus seedlings via mycorrhizal association. After two months, they found 15N in the plant foliage and determined that up to 25% of the Pinus nitrogen came from the springtails, which they had no connection with other than through Laccaria bicolor. Less than 10% of the springtails remained by the end of the experiment. \nAs demonstrated by Schrey et al. (2012), some streptomycete bacteria are able to induce and support the growth of Laccaria bicolor.\nEnvironmental Sensitivity / Indicators:\nLaccaria bicolor is sensitive to soil zinc pollution, but ectomycorrhizal associations with hosts are maintained in the presence of this pollution, as shown by Ottoway et al. (2025)."

    "text": "2. Morphology & Identification\n\nFruiting Body Description: The fruiting body takes the shape of a gilled mushroom that can be 4-10 cm wide and 6-15 cm tall. It has a violet cap and stipe and dark violet, blackish gills. It is generally textured with small hairs and scales.\nCap / Pileus Characteristics: The cap is typically 4-10 cm across and is somewhat velvety, roughened by many hairs and small scales. It tends to crack when dry and is colored a deep blackish violet to deep purple. Unlike many other Cortinarius species, the cap is not slimy.\nGills / Pores / Spines / Teeth / Etc.: The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem. They are covered by a cobwebby purple partial veil when young, but this disappears quickly. They begin as dark purple, become grayish to blackish, and end as rusty brown.\nStipe / Stem / Attachment / Ring / Volva / Base: The stipe is 6-15 cm long, with a base ranging from bulbous to slightly thickened, and has a partial veil. It is somewhat hairy and is not slimy. Over time, the stem darkens deeply, indicating age.\nSpore Print Color: Rusty brown or cinnamon.\nMicroscopic Features: Spores are 11.5-14.5 x 7-9 µm and are ellipsoid to amygadaliform (almond-shaped), with a moderately verrucose (warty) surface texture. The cheilocystidia (edge of gills) and pleurocystidia (face of gills) are fusoid-ventricose (spindle-shaped, wider in the middle), with a long neck. It is the only Cortinarius species with clearly defined cystidia on its gills.\nOther Diagnostic Characters: It is described by various sources as having a cedarwood smell, a sweet fragrance, or no distinct smell. It turns red when it comes into contact with potassium hydroxide (KOH).\nSimilar Species / Potential Confusions:\n\nViscid violet cort (Cortinarius iodes)\nGassy webcap (Cortinarius traganus)\nSilvery-violet cort (Cortinarius alboviolaceus)\nAmethyst deceiver (Laccaria amethystina)\nBlewit (Clitocybe nuda)"

    "text": "2. Morphology & Identification\n\nFruiting Body Description:\nMostly brown with white cap outline. Young fruiting bodies start off light brown and turn a darker shade as they mature, with the mushroom forming frilly rosettes. Its common name is derived from its fan-like shape. Mushrooms as large as 6 cm wide have been observed (iNaturalist.org).\nCap / Pileus Characteristics:\nThe cap is fan-shaped, or semi-circular and slightly depressed (iNaturalist.org; burkeherbarium.org; minnesotaseasons.com). The texture has been described as silky, fibrillose, brown fan-shaped caps, with a leathery texture and a white border (mushroomexpert.com). Sometimes the rim of the cap can be “frilly” (ibid).\nGills / Pores / Spines / Teeth / Etc.:\nGray to brown, smooth, with small pores (iNaturalist.org; burkeherbarium.org; minnesotaseasons.com; mushroomexpert.com). In old age the underside can become slightly wrinkled, sometimes described as “bumpy” (ibid).\nStipe / Stem / Attachment / Ring / Volva / Base:\nThe stipe is usually very short or not present at all–tends to depend on substrate type. The texture of the stipe is tough and its coloration is similar to the cap, maybe slightly lighter (ibid).\nSpore Print Color:\nSpore print is brown (mushroomexpert.com).\nMicroscopic Features (if available):\nThe basidiospores have a “bumpy” or spiny-looking surface. They are about 7-10 μm across and 5-6 μm tall. Similar to a number of other species within basidiomycota, clamp connections visible on T. terrestris hyphae (ibid).\nOther Diagnostic Characters:\nMost sites noted that it does not have a distinctive flavor, but has a moldy earth-like smell (iNaturalist.org; burkeherbarium.org; minnesotaseasons.com; mushroomexpert.com).\nSimilar Species / Potential Confusions:\nAccording to Kuo (mushroomexpert.com), the version of this fungus that grows in North America is probably not the same one that was originally described in Europe in the 18th century! Thelephora palmata is a “stinkier” look-alike of T. terrestris. T. palmata is also more branched and coral-like, and less abundant (iNaturalist.org; burkeherbarium.org; minnesotaseasons.com; mushroomexpert.com). T. vialis is another similar species, but iNat describes it as “more robust.” Cotylidia diaphana and Podoscypha petalodes can look similar as well. Finally, the upper surface of Hydnellum caps resemble those of T. terrestris, but have “teeth” underneath (iNaturalist.org)."

    "text": "3. Distribution & Habitat in Washington\n\nRange & Geographic Distribution in WA:\nWorldwide, T. terrestris exists in almost every continent, but is notably absent between the latitudes 30ºN and 30ºS (minnesotaseasons.com). In Washington, T. terrestris is more commonly found west of the Cascade Range, around King, Snohomish, Skagit, Whatcom, Pierce, Thurston, Mason, Kitsap County, including some recorded sightings in Clallam, Skamania, Stevens, and Spokane County (iNaturalist.org; burkeherbarium.org). The range seems to stretch up the coast, into British Columbia, and southward into Oregon and California. In these regions, T. terrestris finds tend to follow the pattern in Washington: they are localized to the coast, with sparser observations east of the Cascades (iNaturalist.org).\nElevation Range:\nWe could not find any information on elevation range.\nHabitat Types / Substrate Preferences:\nT. terrestris is most commonly found in sandy soils, usually close to or underneath host species (iNaturalist.org). However, this species is quite widely distributed and sturdy, so it can establish on a variety of soil types. For instance, it’s commonly seen on roadside ditches, acidic soils, post-wildfire soils and soils with tephra deposits. It also dominates in ecosystems that have been treated with fungicides and fertilizers (Colpaert 1999).\nHost Associations (if applicable):\nThelephora terrestris has a broad host range. It is best known to associate with conifers in the genera Pinus (pines) and Picea (spruces), and with Pseudotsuga menziesii. T. terrestris also colonizes hosts in the genera Quercus (oaks), Alnus (alder), Populus (cottonwoods, poplar, aspen), Salix (willows), Castanea (chestnut), and Fagus (beech) (Colpaert 1999; minnesotaseasons.com).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.1. observations of T. terrestris in Washington State, recorded in iNaturalist."

    "section": "5. Ecology & Role",
    "text": "5. Ecology & Role\n\nEcological Function:\nThelephora terrestris are ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) with moderate to low saprotrophic capacity (Kanunfre & Zancan 1998; Colpaert 1999; iNaturalist.org; mushroomexpert.com). Given their ability to persevere in a variety of harsh conditions, T. terrestris are primary symbiont colonizers–also known as pioneer mycobionts–and aggressively competitive (Marx et al. 1970, Colpaert 1999). Interestingly, in the early 1900s they were characterized as parasites due to instances of fruiting bodies enveloping and suffocating entire seedlings (Colpaert 1999). Nursery managers inoculate seedlings with T. terrestris with caution because they easily outcompete other EcM species (ibid).\nSubstrate / Decomposition Role:\nThelephora terrestris can tolerate a wide range of soil types, but seems most dominant on disturbed soils, often low in humus and high in acidity, and can tolerate dry or wet conditions. It is commonly found in disturbed sites, as discussed above (Marx et al. 1970, Colpaert 1999). T. terrestris is known to produce exolaccase, which breaks down lignin (Kanunfre & Zancan 1998).\nInteractions:\nThelephora terrestris produce and exude mycotoxins that confer pine hosts protection from Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne oomycete (iNaturalist.org). Phytophthora are destructive plant pathogens that cause root rot and eventual dieback of the plant. T. terrestris has also been observed to support seedling tolerance to stressful environmental conditions in disturbed habitats such as sites high in tephra (Colpaert 1999). Peterzk et al. (2016) described a dsRNA virus (T. terrestris virus 1) that infects T. terrestris. Not much is known about the effect of this virus on T. terrestris. T. terrestris’ aggressive mycorrhizal ability is a double-edged-sword, presenting a challenge for other ectomycorrhizal species that colonize T. terrestris’ hosts. T. terrestris has been observed to easily outcompete other EcM species (Colpaert 1999).\nEnvironmental Sensitivity / Indicators:\nT terrestris is generally a very tolerant species. They can tolerate soils with high or low nitrogen, periods of flooding in soils, and have shown to be fairly tolerant of high concentrations of zinc and copper. T. terrestris is, however, very sensitive to cadmium. Lack of T. terrestris in disturbed sites may indicate high levels of cadmium. T. terrestris is also fairly sensitive to competition, and tends to be less dominant in soils with indigenous mycorrhizal species present (Colpaert 1999)."

Since Pyronema omphalodes has a very specific habitat for growth conditions, if post-fire environments and fire frequency was reduced, there would be less available habitat for Pyronema omphalodes to grow in.\nManagement or Monitoring Notes: Pyronema are not a cultivated species or invasive in environments; they’re lifespans are short-lived and coincide with post-fire recovery. It’d be best to ensure their survival in a post-fire environment due to their abilities to aggregate the soil, decompose charred material, sequester carbon, and capture transient nitrogen pulses after fire."

Ecology & Role\n\nEcological Function (saprotroph, mycorrhizal, parasite, etc.): Saprotroph and parasite of mature conifers in the West.\nSubstrate / Decomposition Role: Saprotroph and parasite of mature or deceased coniferous trees, commonly associated with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) (Beaty Biodiversity Museum). Known to cause brown rot decay in the heartwood of host trees via degradation of both cellulose and hemicellulose (Benitez et al.).\nInteractions (plants, animals, other fungi, pathogens): Exclusively live on, parasitise, and break down conifer trees. Additionally, brown rot and decomposition also have the potential to increase habitat complexity by creating cavities and by leaving behind water-retaining debris, which can improve soil quality (Benitez et al).\nEnvironmental Sensitivity / Indicators: Little information is available regarding the environmental sensitivity of Laetiporus conifericola, though the need for specialized substrate may increase its vulnerability due to habitat loss. Shifts in recorded seasonality in recent years may indicate potential sensitivities to alteration in local weather patterns as a biproduct of climate change, but could also be due to a confounding factor such as increased observation."

    "text": "10. Other Notes & Observations\n\nQuestions / Uncertainties: Laetiporus conifericola itself is poorly described in literature, often in favor of Laetiporus sulphureus, a variety found on hardwoods in eastern North America, or more generally the Laetiporus sulphureus species complex, which is made of many unique species (L. conifericola, L. cincinnatus, L. gilbertsonii, L. huroniensis, and L. sulphureus s.s). The species epithet of Laetiporus conifericola is derived from “conifer,” and “colo”/”colous,” to live in (referring to substrate).\nFun facts: The type specimen of Laetiporus conifericola was collected from a naturally occurring spruce hybrid Picea × lutzii (P. sitchensis x P. glauca) on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska."
