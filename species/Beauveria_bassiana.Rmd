-   **Geographic Distribution in WA:** Distributed mostly along the Western side of Washington
-   **Elevation Range:** Mainly found at low to mid elevations, seems to be found in forested areas
-   **Habitat Types / Substrate Preferences:** Occurs in soil, prefers humid, temperate climates
-   **Host Associations (if applicable): often seen on insects (ants, beetles, moths, worms, bees), has been observed on reptiles**

```{r Distribution-map-WA, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# 1. Get records by taxon_id (Beauveria bassiana = 862160)
beauveria_data <- get_inat_obs(taxon_id = 862160, maxresults = 10000)

# 2. Convert to sf object
beauveria_sf <- beauveria_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(latitude), !is.na(longitude)) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# 3. Get WA state polygon
wa_state <- ne_states(country = "United States of America", returnclass = "sf") %>%
  filter(name == "Washington") %>%
  st_transform(st_crs(beauveria_sf))

# 4. Keep points inside WA
beauveria_wa <- beauveria_sf[st_within(beauveria_sf, wa_state, sparse = FALSE), ]

# 5. Plot
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = wa_state, fill = "gray95", color = "black") +
  geom_sf(data = beauveria_wa, color = "purple", alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "iNaturalist Observations of Beauveria bassiana in Washington State",
    caption = "Data source: iNaturalist"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Seasonality & Phenology

-   **Months of Fruiting in WA:** Has been most observed from June to October
-   **Seasonal Notes:** Peaks in warm, moist weather during these months

```{r Seasonality-plot-WA, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Make sure your date column is parsed
beauveria_data <- beauveria_wa %>%
  mutate(
    observed_on = as.Date(observed_on),
    month_num = month(observed_on),
    month_label = month(observed_on, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(month_num))

# Aggregate by month
monthly_counts <- beauveria_data %>%
  group_by(month_num, month_label) %>%
  summarize(observations = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Make sure months are in calendar order
monthly_counts <- monthly_counts %>%
  arrange(month_num)

#make proportional
monthly_counts <- monthly_counts %>%
  mutate(freq = observations / sum(observations))

# Plot
ggplot(monthly_counts, aes(x = month_num, y = freq)) +
  geom_area(fill = "orchid4", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(color = "purple4", size = 1.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb) +
  labs(
    title = expression("Seasonal Pattern of " * italic("Beauveria bassiana") * " (Relative Frequency)"),
    x = "Month",
    y = "Proportion of Observations"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

## 5. Ecology & Role

-   **Ecological Function:** Saprotroph and/or parasite
-   **Substrate / Decomposition Role:** lives in soil, finds insect as a host, takes over insect body, and eventually decomposes it
-   **Interactions:** Interacts with insects
-   **Environmental Sensitivity / Indicators:** As the weather gets warmer due to climate change, this fungi will likely become more abundant

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Conservation, Abundance & Threats

-   **Abundance / Rarity in WA:** Seems to be moderately abundant in WA
-   **Conservation Status (state, federal, red list):** Does not have a global conservation status, is listed as vulnerable in Alberta and Manitoba, CA
-   **Threats / Pressures:** Climate change, fungi does well in warm, moist environments
-   **Management or Monitoring Notes:** Does not seem to be managed or monitored at this time, not seen as a threat

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Use / Ethnobiology / Toxicology

-   **Edibility / Toxicity:** Not edible, spores may worsen breathing difficulties, at least one case of human infection has been reported in a person with a suppressed immune system
-   **Traditional / Cultural Uses:** Commonly used for pest control
-   **Medicinal / Bioactive Compounds:** This fungus is a contact mycoinsecticide that is registered for use in the US on pests and agricultural and horticultural crops
-   **Cautions / Warnings:** Can be harmful to humans if ingested and can cause eye irritation. Could harm pollinators and other beneficial insects as well as fish.

## 10. Other Notes & Observations

-   **Field Notes / Observations:** Looking at iNaturalist observations most recorded findings of this fungi in Washington state have been in natural areas or forests and have been seen mainly on insects.
-   **Questions / Uncertainties:** Will it eventually become harmful to use this fungi as a pesticide?
-   **Fun facts:** This fungus is a cordiceps and can kill insects within 4-10 days. It is able to infect 700 different species of insects and can colonize plants to help them resist pests.
